# EduCompass

EduCompass is a personal project focused on building a
data-driven, personalized career and education advisory platform
for students, with a special focus on government colleges in India.

## Motivation
Many students struggle with career decisions due to fragmented
information and lack of proper guidance. This project explores how
technology and data analysis can simplify this process.

## What the Project Does
- Collects academic background, interests, and aptitude inputs
- Analyzes skill gaps and education pathways
- Recommends relevant courses and institutions
- Presents insights through a simple dashboard-style interface

## Tech Stack (Planned / Current)
- Frontend: (HTML/CSS/JS / React — whatever you’re using)
- Backend: (Node / Python / etc.)
- Data Sources: Public education datasets (AISHE, NCS – exploratory)

## Current Status
This is an ongoing personal project. The focus is currently on
designing the system flow and building a functional prototype.

## Future Improvements
- Smarter recommendation logic
- Better UI/UX
- Deployment for public access
